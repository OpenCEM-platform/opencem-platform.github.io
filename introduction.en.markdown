The Open In-Context Energy Management Platform (OpenCEM) will provide
a rich, open data set for prediction models and control algorithms
in energy management problems. This data set will include
The installation is currently underway and scheduled to be completed in Summer 2025, with first data publications expected for Fall 2025.
* Time series from a real-world, on-campus PV installation:
  * Generated power.
  * Battery levels.
  * Changing loads.
* Context time series, relevant to the local installation:
  * Event data
  * User-generated context
  * Local news and weather reports.
* A simulator to evaluate in-context learning models, control algorithms and context designs.

The information will be made available through a public API.

This page will be updated with downloads of the data set and API 
documentation in the future as data becomes available.
