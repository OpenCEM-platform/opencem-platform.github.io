The Open In-Context Energy Management Platform (OpenCEM) at the 
Chinese University of Hongkong, Shenzhen aims to promote and enable
in-context learning for prediction and decision models in renewable
energy management through an open data set, simulator and public API.
The data set will be based on a local, in-campus PV installation and 
encourage user-generated context data. The installation is expected 
to start operation in Spring 2025 with first data publications planned 
for Summer 2025.

Please find more details on the planned scope in our project 
[introduction](/introduction.html) and the [demo](/demo.html) for 
the processing of user-generated context.
